#CodeBook for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository contains the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project R script created by Ilkka Melleri.
This documentation describes the data variables used in the script output.

# Data variables
The output data set created by the script contains average values of 66 measurements for 30 subjects each performing 6 different activities.

The 66 measurements are average values of several original measurements that were either standard deviation or average values themselves. Moreover, the measurements are of several different dimensions including time, frequency, spatial (X, Y, Z), body, gyro and gravity acceleration and jerk.

Each variable name in the data set contains includes the type of the original measurement and all dimensions that are included in that measurement.

The variables included in the data set are:
